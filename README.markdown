jquery.tzplaceholder.js

Placeholder replacement for browsers that doesn't support

Attention: look at the index.html to see the example source. Password placeholder and text placeholder have different functions, $.fn.pwdPlaceholder and $.fn.placeholder, in this order.

New param added: Now you can pass a boolean value as the only parameter to opt for force the placeholder, it means that you can use the placeholder even in the browsers that support placeholder by default. Doesn't seen like a big deal, but its handy to test and debug.

the original script, made with Coffee Script is attached on src/ folder.

Thanks for trying the tzplaceholder and tell me about any problem!
